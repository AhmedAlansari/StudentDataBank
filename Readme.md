# Student Data Bank
StudentDataBank.org (SDB) is an organization that offers secure online storage and controlled exchange of student records between universities, colleges, schools and other types of Educational Institutes (EI). EI can establish a secure interface with Student Data Bank and upload its Courses, Programs, Students and Student’s Course Results. An EI can request a Student’s Record to be fetched from another EI. SDB takes care of securely validating the request and fetching Student Records from EI’s systems via the secure interface EI has established with SDB. Thus SDB works as a broker between multiple EI, empowering each to share student records with each other in a secure and auditable manner. An awarding EI can initiate the process of awarding a degree to a student and in the process automatically establish whether the awardee student has completed all the required courses from the awarding EI, as well as from other EIs that the student claims to have attended required courses from. Each EI has a way to define what requirements their courses meet, so that courses can be accepted from other EIs automatically while awarding a degree to a student.
